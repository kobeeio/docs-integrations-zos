= Delete Sources and their associated objects

== Purpose

This is an optional z/OS Phase.

This phase is used to delete the z/OS files selected using the "`.to_be_deleted`" suffix in their respective z/OS PDSs.
The associated files (Load-modules, listing, dbrm, bind files) will also be deleted in the corresponding PDS(s).

This Phase is also used for deleting components of the previous Level of Environment after the Promotion in the normal Environment for the cascade of environments in the Lifecycle.
In that case the option _Deletion_ should be used.
