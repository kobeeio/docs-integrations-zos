|Build
|Used to generate property files.
This phase is only used for non-compiled source files needing specific property files. 

|<<QMFFilesCreate.adoc#_id1695e0706sp,Create QMF Property Files>>
|O
|Build
|Used to generate the property file for the QMF DB2 files.

|<<CicsLoadmodulesActivation.adoc#_id1695k0f01in,Cics Load-modules activation>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to generate PHASEIN CICS commands and to submit them for activating CICS load module files (maps and programs).

|<<CollectIdmsComponents.adoc#_id1695df00qvl,Collect Idms Components>>
|O
|Build
|Used to collect IDMS components. 

|<<CopyFromSourceTarget.adoc#_id1695k0k0ijd,Copy from Source to Target>>
|M
|Build and Deploy
|Selects the files that need to be copied, using predefined filters and include/exclude masks.
Next, the selected files are copied from the Source location to the Target location on the Kobee Agent.

|<<CopyPDSMembersToPDS.adoc#_id1695de00p9r,Copy PDS Members to PDS>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to copy objects between PDSs, for example, for back-up and restore purposes.

|<<CopySourcesBeforeCompilation.adoc#_id1695df0d0lg,Copy Sources to PDS for compilation>>
|M
|Build
|Copies the object types (specified in the properties file) from the Target location on the Kobee Agent into temporary PDSs on the z/OS Platform.

|<<DB2BindsTransferActivation.adoc#_id1695dd00mfu,DB2 Binds transfer and activation>>
|O
|Deploy
|Completes the promotion of the DBRM files with environment data, to transfer and to submit generated JCL(s) for activating DB2 Bind Package and Plan Files. 

|<<DCFFilesDeployment.adoc#_id1695dg00z1h,DCF Files Deployment>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to copy DCF files to the corresponding PDS.

|<<DeleteSourcesAssObjects.adoc#_id1695e0707sa,Delete Sources and their associated objects>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to delete the z/OS files selected using the "`.to_be_deleted`" suffix in their respective z/OS PDSs.
The associated files (Load-modules, listing, dbrm, bind files) will also be deleted in the corresponding PDS(s).

|<<DemotionComponents.adoc#_id1695de00yd4,Demote components and load-modules>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to delete the z/OS files in the PDSs of the Target environment using the Un-deployment option after a bad Promotion.

|<<JclsSubmissionOnJES.adoc#_jcls_submission_on_jes,Jcls submission on JES>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used for submitting the JCLs of a PDS from files list or from target Jes files to JES.

|<<JmanJmodelsControl.adoc#_id1695e0704nk,Jman Jmodels Control>>
|O
|Build
|Used to copy and generate the JCL execution file to validate the Jmodel file in the z/OS environments using the JMAN generator.

|<<JmanJmodelsDeployment.adoc#_id1695e07050q,Jman Jmodels Deployment>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to copy and generate JCL execution file to deploy the Jmodels in the z/OS environments from logical JMAN targets.

|<<JobsSubmissionUsingProgramProperties.adoc#_jobs_submission_using_program_properties,Jobs Submission using Program properties>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used for submitting JOBs with property file of programs from target Job files to JES using models for getting listings and control.

|<<ListFilesFromLocation.adoc#_id16cnb0n0278,List Files from location to CSV or Excel file>>
|O
|Build and Deploy
|Generates a .csv or Excel file listing the files in the target environment.

|<<MapsProgramsCompilation.adoc#_id1695dd0l0vq,Maps and Programs compilation>>
|M
|Build
|Creates the compile JCL, submits the job and runs the actual compilation on z/OS.

After the compile, the Phase will control the result, collect all the files generated by the compile job (listing, load modules, generated DB2 bind files, ...) and put the results, in zipped format, in the Kobee Archive.

|<<PDSAllocationDeletion.adoc#_pdssallocationdeletion,PDSs Allocation or Deletion>>
|O
|Build and Deploy
|This phase is used to create or delete work PDS(s) as package PDS(s) for compiling.
This is done per object type based on the Environment parameters, e.g., the first qualifiers, the prefixes, ... defined in the environment properties file.

|<<DatacomComponentsPromotion.adoc#_id1695k0f02da,Promote Datacom components>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to submit a JCL for importing Datacom Plans in a Datacom environment.

|<<DebuggerUpdate.adoc#_id1695k0f028f,Promote Debugger components>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to submit a JCL for moving (if asked) components from Source to Target Debugger files in a z/OS Environment.

|<<EndevorComponentsPromotion.adoc#_id1695k0f03ub,Promote Endevor components>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to submit a JCL for moving components from Stage to Target Endevor Environment.

|<<IdmsComponentsPromotion.adoc#_id1695k0f0377,Promote Idms components>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to transfer component files to z/OS and to update the target dictionary with the different types of IDMS components loaded with the generated JCL.
i.e., Idmsdddl, Rhdcmap, Schema and Subschema.
Next, the JCL runs the DCMT statements for new copies.

|<<PromotionComponentsLoadModules.adoc#_id1695e0706y6,Promote of components and load-modules>>
|O
|Deploy
|Copies the z/OS files selected from the Environment Target to their respective z/OS PDSs.
The load-modules are copied to temporary sequential files and the script creates and submits a JCL for receiving them in their PDSs.

|<<QMFFilesDeployment.adoc#_id1695e0707mg,QMF Files Deployment>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to import QMF DB2 files in the z/OS environment.

|<<SQLDB2UpdatesExecution.adoc#_id1695e07074t,SQL DB2 files Execution>>
|O
|Deploy
|Used to complete SQL DB2 files with environment DB2 parameters _with_ variable replacements and to submit them, first for executing the DDL (data definition language) Files and next for executing the SQL (standard) Files on the DB2 Database.
