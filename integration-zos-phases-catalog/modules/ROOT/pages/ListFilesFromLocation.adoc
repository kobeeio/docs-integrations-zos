[[_id16cnb0n0278]]
= List Files from location to CSV or Excel file 

== Purpose

This is an optional z/OS Phase.

Generates a .csv or Excel file listing the files in the target environment (by default). This can be useful to get an overview of the files (and their dependent objects) that have been transferred.

Generates a .csv file or an Excel file listing the files in the target environment (by default). This can be useful to get an overview of the files (and their dependent objects) that have been transferred at a specific moment.
The final objective is to load this result list in a table to provide a report on the file deployments.
It can be completed by the _Register environment
Files Activity_ Phase, which is not a "`z/OS`" but a "`Tools`" Phase, and the _File Environment Activity_ project for reporting with the extra "`fileEnvironmentActivity`" Report installed with ALM_Reports.

== Usage

The _List Files from location to CSV or Excel
file_ Phase can be used on Build and Deploy Environments. 

This Phase is dependent on the <<CopyFromSourceTarget.adoc#_id1695k0k0ijd,Copy from Source to Target>> Phase of you want to list the Target location files.
If required, this Phase may also be used for other locations.
