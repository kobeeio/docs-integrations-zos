Models, in full: JCL models, are basically job card templates with property placeholders. The placeholders are used to customize the job card according to the type of source code and the z/OS environment it will run in. For every JCL step that is needed, a JCL Model is retrieved from the JCL Models collection that is displayed in this Models section.

Click the menu item “Models”.

The Model list table displays all the available JCL Models. The models can be sorted alphabetically by name or by export path.
