In order to use configuration sets they need to be exported to the folder locations configured in Kobee for z/OS. These folder locations define where Kobee for z/OS has to pick up the configuration and models and they may vary depending on the environment types (e.g. Build, Test,…) so make sure to check the parameters defined both on the machine and environment levels.

KRC offers some example locations that can be customized to your preference.

Click the “Export” button to export the configuration set.
The configuration and models are exported into distinct folders by default, if needed the folder structure can be changed on the “Configuration Sets” page by clicking the “Edit” link in the breadcrumb.

It is not possible to export to all export locations at once.

To create a new export location click the “New Export Location” link, in the pop-up panel enter a name in the “Name” text box for the location preferably reflecting the target environment type (BUILD, TEST,…) and a folder location in the “Export Path”.
