* Preprocessor: configuration of how source code is recognized and processed
* Compilation: definition of the required JCL steps for a language
* Build Environment: to set the properties of a specific feature on the Build environment.
* Deploy Environment: to set the properties of a specific feature on the Deploy environment.

The configuration file info panel shows the available actions at the left side of the file name and a delete button on the right side followed by a description at the bottom. The available actions are:

* Copy: copies the current configuration item to a Configuration Set of choice. KRC appends the configuration file name with “_Copy” to avoid duplicate configuration files, alternatively you can choose another name.
* Preview: shows a rendered preview of the current configuration item. Note that a configuration item needs to be saved first (using the button at the end of the page) before changes are visible.
* Edit Model: edits the configuration item details such as the File Name, Export Path and Description.

A “Back” action link is displayed below the info panel to get back to the configuration set page.
In the “Edit <configuration item name> parameters configuration” panel below the info panel you can edit the parameters that belong to the configuration item.

The header displays the 2 following action links:

* Show Inactive Items: this option allows you to hide the inactive parameter items from the panel in order to improve the panel overview.
* Show Descriptions: provides a description of the parameters.

Active parameters are always visible but can be set inactive by moving the switch button at the right side of the parameters item value. When a parameters is mandatory it can not be set inactive.
When you have finished editing the configuration item, always save your changes first (using the button at the end of the page) before going back to the configuration set.

*Custom properties*

When a required parameter is not present in the default parameter list, it is possible to create a new  parameter by clicking the “Add a Custom Property” action link.

=== Special cases of configuration set items
There are special cases of configuration items where the configuration set item represents a collection rather that a single item, these are:
* ObjectTypes
* Source Rules
* Languages 

The screenshot below show an example of the ObjectTypes “globalObjtypes.properties” item.

The configuration file info panel shows the available actions at the left side of the file name and a delete button on the right side followed by a description at the bottom. The available actions are:
* Copy: copies the current configuration item to a Configuration Set of choice. KRC appends the configuration file name with “_Copy” to avoid duplicate configuration files, alternatively you can choose another name.
* Preview: shows a rendered preview of the current configuration item. Note that a configuration item needs to be saved first (using the button at the end of the page) before changes are visible.
* Edit Model: edits the configuration item details such as the File Name, Export Path and Description.

A “Back” action link is displayed below the info panel to get back to the configuration set page.

The “ObjectType list” panel below the info panel shows all the available object types. Also, you can create a new object type if necessary by clicking the “New Object Type” action link.

An object type can be copied by clicking the icon in front of the object type name, it can also be deleted by clicking the red button on the right side of the object type row. To edit an object click the object type name. Below is an example of the “ACAT” object type.
