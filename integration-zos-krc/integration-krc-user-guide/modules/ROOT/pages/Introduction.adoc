= Kobee Resource Configurator User Guide
Kobee Resource Configurator, or in short KRC, is a web-based companion application for the Kobee for z/OS solution. KRC offers a user-friendly GUI for working with configuration settings, models and resources that are required for the customization of the Kobee for z/OS solution.

An important part of the Kobee for z/OS solution involves generating JCL code, which is used on the z/OS  mainframe for the compile and promote processes. The Phases which compose the JCL depend on the models and resources (configuration sets) that are generated by KRC.
